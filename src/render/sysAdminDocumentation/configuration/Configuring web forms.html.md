## Introduction

ReDBox has a flexible and configurable framework that allows you to capture as metadata for a variety different purposes such as data management plans, provisioned workspaces and data collections. Metadata is stored in the [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) format and has a very loose schema to support this flexibility.

For each type of metadata record stored, it is also possible to configure a workflow that the record may pass through to map to the business processes within your organisation.

There is also a configurable form system that allows you to design a form to meet your needs without having the need to understand code. It is possible to attach different form structures to each workflow stage to suit the requirements for the user of the form.

## Record Type Configuration

Record Types are configured in the `config/recordtype.js` file.

The record type configuration defines the record type (e.g. a research data managment plan record) and what fields in the record should be displayed on the search interface for the purposes of filtering and faceting.


Record's are configured via the config/workflow.js file and specifies the workflow stages a record can transition through and the roles that are permitted to view and edit a record for each workflow stage.


```
<record-type>
|
|- search-filters []
    |- name
    |- title
    |- type
    |- typeLabel
```
Where <> are property labels that are variables.

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                                                                              | Required | Example        |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------|
| < record-type >    | The label of record type | Yes      | rdmp           |
| name  | The name of the Solr index field to facet on. For facet type fields, this is usually the name you've configured in your form configuration. To allow for inexact matching for filter search boxes, append `text_` to the beginning of the name | Yes      | text_title         |
| title  | The heading label to display in the facets section. Can read text from the language file | Yes      | search-refine-description           |
| type  | The type of facet. Fixed for search box filters, facet for facet counts | Yes      | facet           |
| typeLabel  | The label to show above the search box filter. Can read text from the language file. Set to null for facet count fields | Yes      | search-refine-contains           |

#### Example
```
"rdmp": {
  searchFilters: [
    {
      name: "text_title",
      title: "search-refine-title",
      type: "exact",
      typeLabel: "search-refine-contains"
    },
    {
      name: "text_description",
      title: "search-refine-description",
      type: "exact",
      typeLabel: "Can read text from the language file"
    },
    {
      name: "grant_number_name",
      title: "search-refine-grant_number_name",
      type: "facet",
      typeLabel: null,
      alwaysActive: true
    },
    {
      name: "finalKeywords",
      title: "search-refine-keywords",
      type: "facet",
      typeLabel: null,
      alwaysActive: true
    },
    {
      name: "workflow_stageLabel",
      title: "search-refine-workflow_stageLabel",
      type: "facet",
      typeLabel: null,
      alwaysActive: true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Workflow Configuration

The structure of the configuration is as follows


```
<record-type>
|
|- <workflow-stage>
    |
    |- config
        |
        |- workflow
            |
            |- stage
            |- stageLabel
            |- next
        |- authorization
            |
            |- viewRoles
            |- editRoles
        |- form
    |- starting
```
Where <> are property labels that are variables.

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                                                                              | Required | Example        |

| stage            | The code value for the stage. This value is stored in the metadata record within ReDBox. Best practice would be to match it with < workflow-stage > but it can be different if necessary.  | Yes      | draft          |
| stageLabel       | The label for the stage that is presented to users on the interface.                                                                                                                     | Yes      | Draft          |

## Form/view configuration

The form and view layout is configured via config/form.js file.

The structure of the configuration file is as follows

```
defaultForm
|
|- forms
    |
    |- <form-name>
        |
        |- name
        |- type
        |- skipValidationOnSave
        |- editCssClasses
        |- viewCssClasses
        |- messages
            |
            |- <message-code>
        |
        |- fields []
            |
            |- class
            |- compClass
            |- viewOnly
            |- definition
                |
                |- <component specific properties>

```

### Form-wide configuration

| compClass  |  The Component class name. See the [Component documentation](https://redbox-mint.github.io/redbox-portal/components/ContributorComponent.html) for a list of available components and how to configure them | Yes                    |   TextBlockComponent      |
| viewOnly   | When set to true, this component will only appear in the view (details) rendition of the form | No (defaults to false) | true    |
| editOnly   | When set to true, this component will only appear in the edit (details) rendition of the form | No (defaults to false) | true    |

How to configure a component is described in the [Component documentation](https://redbox-mint.github.io/redbox-portal/components/ContributorComponent.html)  | Yes                    |  value: '@dmpt-data-collection-heading' |


### Example

```
fields: [
  {
    class: 'Container',
    compClass: 'TextBlockComponent',
    viewOnly: true,
    definition: {
      name: 'title',
      type: 'h1'
    }
  },
```

## Language Configuration

Messages in the system can be configured using Language files. This allows for internationalisation of the portal as well as editing in a translation management system such as [Locize](https://locize.com).

The application uses [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) to render the messages and the language files are kept in the assests/locales/<language> directories.

Please see the [i18next documentation](https://www.i18next.com/essentials.html) for more information on how the language file is structured and it's features.
