# Introduction

This installation guide can get you up and running using a few different methods:

1. [Installation on Ubuntu](./ubuntuInstallation.html)
2. [Installation on CentOS](./centosInstallation.html)
3. [Installation using Docker](./dockerInstallation.html)


If you are wishing to run the installation on your local machine for evaluation purposes you may wish to try our [Vagrant box](../sysAdminDocumentation/vagrant.html) which the development team uses.
